# Welcome to the Payload Wiki
This wiki is so we can have a place to put information so everyone on the team can learn and e on the same page. 

### Resources for contributing
- [Online Markdown Editor](https://dillinger.io/)
    - GitHub uses markdown for the syntax, so here is an online editor that automatically renders what you write (I'm using it right now)
- [Markdown Cheat Sheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#links)
    - Here is a cheat sheet that shows all of the markdown syntax so it's easier to create things like lists or hyperlinks

### Todo
I want to start adding information related to all things payload here. So any information about gliders or drones or autorotation or cool youtube videos. I think there should be a folder stucture for new stuff and a guide for how to add information. So I'll work on that this over fall break
