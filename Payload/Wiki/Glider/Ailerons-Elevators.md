### How do planes turn with their ailerons?

An aircraft is turned by banking the wing. This is achieved via aileron deflection (the flaps on the wings). For example, if wanting to turn left, the left aileron would go up and the right aileron would go down. The right wing would generate comparatively more lift and cause the aircraft to rotate along the roll axis toward the left wing. Breaking down the lift into its constituent vectors, it can be seen the aircraft will turn left. However, in generating lift by deflecting the airflow, more drag is necessarily incurred on the right wing. This causes the aircraft to rotate along the yaw axis toward the right wing. This is known as adverse yaw. A rudder can be used to counteract this skidding effect by turning it opposite the direction of the slip. 

Aside: To compensate for the decrease in lift due to ailerons, consider the use of an elevator to maintain altitude
